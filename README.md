# Social Network API

## Description
In this project, I developed an API for a social network web application where users can register, share thoughts, react to each other's thoughts, and add friends. The API includes routes for both users and thoughts to create, retreive by ID, retreive all, update by ID, and delete by ID. Additionally, I created add and delete routes for both friends and reactions.
